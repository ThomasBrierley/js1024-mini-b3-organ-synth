Mini-B3 Organ Synth
===================

A JS-1024 2022 submission by tomxor (Thomas Brierley).

An organ synthesiser in 1024 bytes of HTML and JavaScript which attempts to
model a Hammond B3 tonewheel organ.

It can be played in real-time in the browser with good latency using an ordinary
computer keyboard (key map below).  The standard 9 harmonic drawbars and a
reverb effect switch are included on screen and can be adjusted using the mouse.
It's usually best to zoom the page a bit to your preference first using ctrl+.

It uses additive synthesis to model the tonewheel source sounds, using the same
9 harmonics of a Hammond organ.  It also uses the closest note rather than
idealistic harmonics just like a real tonewheel organ for an accurate sound and
a more efficient emulation.  A chorus effect is implemented via a 2nd duplicate
set of detuned harmonics, again just like a real tonewheel organ.

For the Leslie speaker commonly paired with these organs, a less physically
accurate emulation is used for simplicity: The vibrato and phase shifting effect
are emulated in combination using LFOs at the source end, which produces a
fairly believable effect but with too much regularity.  This is permanently
stuck in the "tremolo" mode since there is no space for a switch.
