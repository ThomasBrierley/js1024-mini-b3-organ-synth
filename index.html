Tonewheel organs can be considered the earliest kind of additive synthesizers.
Pressing a single key causes a bunch of different frequency tonewheels to play
at the same time, "adding" together to give the organ's unique sound.  Organ
drawbars correspond to these frequencies and adjust how loud each frequency is
much like an equalizer, except unlike an equalizer the frequency is relative to
the note played rather than absolute.

A limited number of tonewheels can physically fit inside of an organ, and each
has a fixed frequency. For this reason drawbars correspond to neighbouring notes
rather than exact harmonics which allow the most efficient use of available
tonewheels - many of the idealised drawbar harmonics are exactly the same as
note frequencies anyway, but others are slightly off. As far I understand this
difference causes a slight dissonance that is part of the unique sound.

This essentially means there is one physical tonewheel for each note, and when
you play one key, you are actually playing a big chord of relative notes... When
you play multiple keys at once those chords start to overlap and some underlying
tonewheels will be shared, but louder.  This is an important optimisation, even
though it's separated by a century of technology it's still relevant to software
which can only simulate a limited number of oscillators simultaneously.

The arrays F[] and A[] define the drawbars, and for the above reasons F[]
actually corresponds to relative notes rather than accurate harmonic orders.
A[] are the amplitudes which are also the drawbar states.

The function O() returns the global oscillator for a given note from a shared
pool, allowing oscillators to be shared between keys just like tonewheels. It
dynamically creates and destroys them as needed.

The other significant element of this organ's sound is the Leslie Speaker...
Essentially a spinning speaker in a box which causes three distinct effects in
the resulting waveform: tremolo (amplitude modulation from changing proximity),
vibrato (frequency modulation from Doppler shift) and phase shifting (due to
Doppler shifted waves propagating around the cabinet and recombining).  An
authentic simulation is too demanding for a 1k demo, however the most prominent
effects can be mimicked more abstractly:

For vibrato, a global LFO (low frequency oscillator) modulates the frequency of
all notes by 1/5th of a note at 5Hz.  For phase shifting the vibrato is extended
to 2 global LFOs with a ~1 Hz separation, and the harmonics are duplicated with
one LFO controlling each set. The slight difference in LFO frequency will cause
the two oscillators for each harmonic to gradually slide in and out of phase.
These are then mixed together to produce the phase shifting waveform, with
slight separation to produce a stereo effect.

An accidental side effect of the 2nd set of harmonics is a chorus effect,
because they needed to be detuned slightly to appear as distinct notes to the
oscillator pool. It turns out Hammond use the same principle, adding a 2nd set
of slightly detuned tonewheels for their chorus effect, so this was retained.

Finally, some Leslie Speakers include an electronic reverb effect. The two
general approaches to reverb in web audio are convolver nodes, which are too
slow for real-time; and delay line buffers, which are too complex.  So This demo
uses a simpler but less physically correct approach by pretending reverb is part
of the source sound. The standard ADSR envelope has been extended to include a
final decay stage representing the long reverb tail that emerges after a source
stops playing.  This only emulates non-cumulative reverb for keys that have
stopped playing, which tends to be where the effect is most prominent.
